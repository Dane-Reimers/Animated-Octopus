Animated Octopus
========================================

![Octopus Gif](resources/OctoGif.gif)

For this project I created an animated octopus using OpenGL. The design of the octopus was created using only a sphere and cylinder. The sphere was downloaded as OBJ file and the cylinder is created in the code using an index buffer to keep track of positions and normals. To create the octopus, copies of the sphere and cylinder were manipulated with transformations, rotations, and scaling using matrices. The animation is also done using matrices to manipulate the objects. The scene is colored based off the normals of the objects.
